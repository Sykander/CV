# Douglas Thomson

A recently graduated [Makers](https://makers.tech) software engineer, I have ample experience in database engineering, programming, automating and coding. As someone who is naturally drawn to complex, tricky problems, programming enables me to construct powerful and creative solutions.

Following a degree in Mathematics at King’s College London, I spent three years working as a database engineer at Planning-Inc. I left in the new year, began teaching myself to code and graduated from Makers, a 16-week intensive course in software development, this October. As well as technical skills, the Makers experience engrained the importance of coding best practices, enriched core communication skills and revealed the benefits of agile software development. I spent the rest of the year as a freelance technologist for a creative studio and volunteering at my local yoga studio.

I thrive in the company of people who share my appreciation for good engineering and desire for continual development. I’m excited to take the perspectives and tools I have gained this year into the next stage of my career.

## Skills

### Problem Solving
- An analytical mind with the confidence to tackle large problems head-on. Experienced in breaking down complex systems into fundamental parts and building from there.
- At Planning-Inc, the daily processing ran using a monolithic collection of scripts which could be delayed in entirety by a single late data source. I implemented a solution which split the code into independent phases which were run as soon as their dependencies were met. This extra time allowed the team to correct the missing dependency, bringing daily processing back within the successful time frame despite the error.
- I enjoy spending time solving exercises on sites such as [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/), [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com) and [AdventOfCode](https://adventofcode.com/).

### Tool Building
- At Planning-Inc, I proposed and led a project to build a generic data loader package. It reduced the time taken to integrate new data sources from two days to half a day.
- Similarly, in response to a complicated recovery mechanism for errors in daily processing, I built stored procedures to handle all common tasks and checks. This reduced time taken to recover and prevented knock-on effects from human error.

### Process Improvement
- At Planning-Inc, I moved management of daily processing over to new features of Microsoft SQL server, improving reliability of processing and consistency of logging over the old system without having to write bespoke code.

### Knowledge Sharing
- I became an expert in Planning-Inc’s code base and was responsible for onboarding new team members.
- While at Makers I ran informal workshops for our group projects, sharing technical knowledge and developing the direction of the project.
